                city planning. Additionally, it was recognized as a World Heritage Site. In the surroundings there are a large amount of Maya archaeological
                sites, out of which 16 are opened to the public, including Calakmul, the largest Maya city that has ever been discovered.

                these the extraordinary haciendas. Understandable, jointly with such a rich a unique intangible heritage, Campeche has its own people
